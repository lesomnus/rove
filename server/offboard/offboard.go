// Package offboard is what leaves with a tenant: everything it has, written
// out, and then everything it has, gone (design 8.2, "테넌트 탈퇴").
//
// The order is the design's -- export, a grace, then the purge -- and it is the
// operator's to keep: `rove tenant export`, and `rove tenant purge` once the
// grace an offboarding gives is over. A tenant under a legal hold is refused
// both the purge and nothing else; its export is exactly what a hold is for.
//
// Both work on the database directly, through the deployment's own client and
// never a request: no role in a tenant may take everything out of it, and a
// purge goes through rows no server would let anybody erase.
