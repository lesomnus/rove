// Package policy says what each role may call (design 9.3).
//
// It is a table, and what is not in it is refused. A method added to the schema
// is closed until somebody decides who may call it, which is the direction a
// mistake should fall in.
//
// It is also what seals the rows only the domain layer writes. The history
// rows, the events, the allocations and the rest have generated Add, Patch and
// Erase like everything else, and nothing here gives them to anybody: the
// domain layer writes them from behind the gate, where a policy is not asked,
// and a caller asking for them directly is refused before anything is read.
// The same goes for the generated Patch of everything the domain completes --
// an asset changes through Move and SetAttributes, so that the history is
// written with it, and never by a Patch that would leave the history behind.
//
// A policy is asked once per call, about the method the caller named, and a
// batch asks it once per operation. What the domain layer then calls on the
// caller's behalf is not asked about again; that is the point of the layer.
