-- The domain layer already refuses all of this; these are the second answer,
-- for the day it has a bug. Every statement is safe to run again, so this
-- runs after every migration rather than being tracked.
--
-- The constraints are deferred to the end of the transaction because the
-- domain layer writes a change as "supersede the old row, then insert the new
-- ones", and in between the two are briefly both current.

-- In `public`, where every schema of the database finds it: an extension is
-- one per database, and a schema that is dropped -- a test's -- must not take
-- it along. Two processes migrating at once race on it, and the loser finds
-- it made.
