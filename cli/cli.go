// Package cli is this app's command line, and what only a process does.
//
// `cmd` is the wiring both entry points share -- `Build` is there, and an app's
// sandbox calls it to stand up the same server the process stands up. This
// package is everything on the other side of that: parsing arguments, the
// database engine a process opens, and what to do about the shape of a database
// that was already there.
//
// # Why a package and not a build tag
//
// Because the linker follows imports. A blank-imported driver or a migration
// engine named in `cmd` is linked into the sandbox whether the page can use it
// or not, and neither is small: measured on payday's own app, the wazero SQLite
// engine was 15 MB of the sandbox module and Atlas -- which `Schema.Create`
// reaches -- another 10.5 MB, out of 72 MB the browser had to download.
//
// A `//go:build !js` on each would also have done it, and is worse: a tag
// refuses to compile what would compile, and says nothing about why. What is
// true is that a process and a page need different things, and a package
// boundary is how Go says that. Nothing here is excluded from a build; the
// sandbox simply does not import it.

// `config`, `config env` and `version` are the commands that run against a
// **deployment** rather than against a checkout, and every one of them needs
// something only the app can hand over. `config env` is the clearest: listing
// the variables a deployment can set means walking this struct, and the struct
// is the app's. `version` is payday's; the two `config` are xli's, beside what
// reads the configuration.
//
// `serve` is not among them and will not be. It is the one command whose body
// is the stack -- which layers, in which order, with the wall on which server
// -- and that is the most important thing a reader of an app can see.
//
// The configuration is read on the **root**, so it has happened whichever
// subcommand runs -- `config` prints what came out, `serve` listens on what it
// says. A command that loaded it for itself would be one more place for the
// order to be wrong. What `c` holds when the loader is made is the defaults:
// every load starts from it, and the file, the environment and the flags go
