// somebody up is a query against servers generated from this app's schema, and
// payday has no name for them. What payday supplies is the interface and the
// interceptor that uses it -- and the rule that what comes back is a row read
// from the database rather than one the caller described.

// is calling happens **before** there is anybody to be walled by, so a resolver
// behind the wall would be asking a question whose answer it needs in order to
// ask it.
