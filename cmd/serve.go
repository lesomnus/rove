	// Dialect is what that driver speaks, which `Open` worked out and nothing

	// Watch is what a change is published to once the call that made it has

	// its own work through -- putting the first tenant there, working out who
	// is calling. Neither is a privilege anybody holds: the second is a server

	//
	// It is set after [Build] rather than being one of its arguments, because
	// what reads a credential is often built from what [Build] made: a session
	// handler needs a store, and a store is a table in this database.

	// Policy is what a caller may do and which tenants they may see, and nil is
	// the answer payday gives on its own: their own tenant and nothing more.

	// A field beside [Server.Auth] because they are the pair -- who is calling,
	// and what that means here -- and because the two places it has to be
	// installed are not one place. `gate.Interceptor` covers the calls gRPC
	// dispatches; `c.Server.Guard` covers the operations inside a batch, which
	// arrive as one method carrying many and would otherwise be authorised as
	// the batch rather than as themselves.
	//
	// It is what a second binary is built from. A deployment that wants an
	// operator's path serves this app again with a policy that answers
	// differently, on an address only an operator can reach, rather than
	// putting a rule in here that says some row is special.
