	// Walled is what a caller reaches, and Ungated is what the deployment does
	// its own work through -- putting the first tenant there, working out who
	// is calling. Neither is a privilege anybody holds: the second is a server

	// and what that means here -- and because the two places it has to be
	// installed are not one place. `gate.Interceptor` covers the calls gRPC
	// dispatches; `c.Server.Guard` covers the operations inside a batch, which
	// arrive as one method carrying many and would otherwise be authorised as
	// the batch rather than as themselves.
	//
	// It is what a second binary is built from. A deployment that wants an
